            Recycling is one of the keys to sustainability. And there is no recycling more efficient than the
            second-hand
            market. The growing awareness of climate change and the environment is triggering the use of buying and
            selling
            platforms. According to the "Second Hand Effect" report, the method used to calculate the potential benefit
            for
            the climate derived from the second-hand market is based on the assumption that each used item sold replaces
            the
            production of a new equivalent item, as well as the management of the waste of said product. That is, if a
            person buys a used bicycle instead of a new one, there will be no need to produce a new one and, in
            addition,
            the used one will not have to be processed to turn it into waste.

            Reyours understanding this problem arises as a channel that connects people who want to donate an article
            that,
            even being second hand, is still useful and therefore could be used by another person who needs it.

            Reyours allows the virtual communication of people who, although unknown, are aware of the problems of
            climate
            change and other factors of social nature so they accept with pleasure the acquisition and donation of
            second-hand items
